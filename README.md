# pitch-perfect_v1.1
This is Branch Version 1.1 of Pitch Perfect iOS App
Corrects the *** bad *** parts of the code given by Udacity Reviewer
(Sorry - just sloppy - didn't do the necessary tidying up of initial prototype)

# From the original readme
This is a starter swift project to gain a basic understanding of UIKit and AVFoundation classes.<BR>
The idea is to write a simple program to record audio and play it back with any one of 4 effects: <BR>
  a. Slow Playback (1/2 the recorded speed) <BR>
  b. Fast Playback (2X the recorded speed) <BR>
  c. Playback at higher pitch (to sound like a chipmunk)<BR> 
  d. Playback at lower pitch (to sound like Darth Vader)<BR>
